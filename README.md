The analysis starts with loading the dataset and performing EDA to check for missing values, data types, and summary statistics. The price per square foot distribution shows a right-skewed pattern, indicating a few high-priced properties as outliers. To handle this, outlier detection methods like Mean & Standard Deviation, Percentile Method, IQR, and Z-score are applied, with IQR-based trimming proving to be the most effective. Box plots highlight extreme outliers, while histograms confirm the skewness in price distribution. Scatter plots show relationships between price and area, and the correlation heatmap reveals a strong connection between total price and property size. After cleaning and transforming the data, the dataset becomes more reliable for real estate trend analysis and decision-making.
